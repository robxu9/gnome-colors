The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the GNOME desktop as elegant, consistent and colorful as possible.

The current goal is to allow full color customization of themes, icons, GDM logins and splash screens. There are already seven full color-schemes available; Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red), Noble (Purple), Wise (Green), Dust (Chocolate) and Illustrious (Pink).
An unlimited amount of color variations can be rebuilt and recolored from source, so users need not stick to the officially supported color palettes.

GNOME-Colors is mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary, Tango-Generator and many other open-source projects. More information can be found in the AUTHORS file.
